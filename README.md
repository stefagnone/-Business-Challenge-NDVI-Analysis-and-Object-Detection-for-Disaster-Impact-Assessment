## Project Overview
This project evaluates the environmental impact of Hurricane Maria using Sentinel-2 satellite data through NDVI analysis and object detection models. The key objectives were to identify areas most affected by the hurricane, develop a YOLO-based object detection model, and provide actionable recommendations for disaster recovery efforts.

### Key Highlights:
- Conducted pre- and post-event NDVI analysis to quantify hurricane-affected areas.
- Labeled and prepared image datasets for object detection modeling using YOLO with 50 epochs.
- Developed visualizations and actionable recommendations for recovery efforts.
- Submitted a structured Jupyter Notebook with analysis, dataset preparation, and code.

This project demonstrates skills in geospatial analysis, machine learning for image processing, and disaster recovery planning.
